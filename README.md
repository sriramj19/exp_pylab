# exp_pylab
__author__ = "Sriram Jayaraman"

This is a simple script to implement the cross-breed of matplotlib and numpy. The pylab package is an odd addendum to the matplotlib including the numpy package. So, this script is the result when the two other codes in exp_numpy and exp_matplotlib reposiataries were played around with. Note that both numpy and matplotlib packages are used within the context.
